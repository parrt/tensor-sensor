        Augment tensor-related exceptions generated from numpy, pytorch, and tensorflow.
        Also display a visual representation of the offending Python line that
        shows the shape of tensors referenced by the code. All you have to do is wrap
        the outermost level of your code and clarify() will activate upon exception.

        Visualizations pop up in a separate window unless running from a notebook,
        in which case the visualization appears as part of the cell execution output.

        There is no runtime overhead associated with clarify() unless an exception occurs.

        The offending code is executed a second time, to identify which sub expressions
        are to blame. This implies that code with side effects could conceivably cause
        a problem, but since an exception has been generated, results are suspicious
        anyway.

        Example:

        import numpy as np
        import tsensor

        b = np.array([9, 10]).reshape(2, 1)
        with tsensor.clarify():
            np.dot(b,b) # tensor code or call to a function with tensor code

        See examples.ipynb for more examples.

        :param fontname: The name of the font used to display Python code
        :param fontsize: The font size used to display Python code; default is 13.
                         Also use this to increase the size of the generated figure;
                         larger font size means larger image.
        :param dimfontname:  The name of the font used to display the dimensions on the matrix and vector boxes

                               no hope to discover this information accurately in all cases.
                               Certainly, I gave up after spending huge effort. We have a
                               situation here where the font should be constant width, so
                               we can just use a simple scaler times the font size  to get
                               a reasonable approximation to the width and height of a
                               character box; the default of 1.8 seems to work reasonably
                               well for a wide range of fonts, but you might have to tweak it
                               when you change the font size.
        :param fontcolor:  The color of the Python code.

        :param error_op_color: The color to use for characters associated with the erroneous operator
        :param ax: If not none, this is the matplotlib drawing region in which to draw the visualization
        :param dpi: This library tries to generate SVG files, which are vector graphics not
                    2D arrays of pixels like PNG files. However, it needs to know how to
                    compute the exact figure size to remove padding around the visualization.
                    Matplotlib uses inches for its figure size and so we must convert
                    from pixels or data units to inches, which means we have to know what the
                    dots per inch, dpi, is for the image.

                            unhandled code caught by my parser are ignored. Turn this off

        As the Python virtual machine executes lines of code, generate a
        visualization for tensor-related expressions using from numpy, pytorch,
        and tensorflow. The shape of tensors referenced by the code are displayed.

        Visualizations pop up in a separate window unless running from a notebook,
        in which case the visualization appears as part of the cell execution output.

        There is heavy runtime overhead associated with explain() as every line
        is executed twice: once by explain() and then another time by the interpreter
        as part of normal execution.

        Expressions with side effects can easily generate incorrect results. Due to
        this and the overhead, you should limit the use of this to code you're trying
        to debug.  Assignments are not evaluated by explain so code `x = ...` causes
        an assignment to x just once, during normal execution. This explainer
        knows the value of x and will display it but does not assign to it.

        Upon exception, execution will stop as usual but, like clarify(), explain()
        will augment the exception to indicate the offending sub expression. Further,
        the visualization will deemphasize code not associated with the offending
        sub expression. The sizes of relevant tensor values are still visualized.

        Example:

        import numpy as np
        import tsensor

        b = np.array([9, 10]).reshape(2, 1)
        with tsensor.explain():
            b + b # tensor code or call to a function with tensor code
